## About
The Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) is a student-led community backed by Google Developers aimed at empowering undergraduate students from all disciplines to grow their knowledge in technology, build solutions for their local communities, and connect with other members from the Google community.

## Creating impact and empowering students through technology
Whether you are new to software development or you've been developing for quite a while, GDSC is a place where you can learn new technologies, make your ideas a reality, and collaborate to solve real-world problems. In addition to solving problems, GDSC will allow you to connect with other technology enthusiasts from other GDSC chapters and the Google Developer Community. We will be hosting events and activities for all students throughout the academic year. We hope to see you there!

## Community Projects are back for Fall 2021!
Community Projects is a semester-long program where students create software-based solutions for a problem in their community. By being a part of a community project, youâ€™ll gain industry-standard knowledge and experience of must-have skills such as Python, Java, web development, backend/frontend development, databases, and much more!
You could potentially earn a credit for CSC392/CSC492 while working on your project under faculty guidance! Additionally, you may be able to submit your project as a part of the global DSC Solution challenge by Google.
Don't worry you don't need to come with a project idea or a team to apply. You will have tons of opportunities to form teams and brainstorm ideas!
